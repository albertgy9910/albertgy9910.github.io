**Central Air-Conditioning Intelligent Temperature Control Project (Jun 2021 - Dec 2021)**

This project involved establishing a continuous monitoring and adjustment system for temperature and humidity, designed to enhance stability and reduce energy consumption.

- Established a 24/7 temperature and humidity monitoring and adjustment system that records data every 5 minutes without interruption, with a data retention capacity of three years.
- Automatically adjusted the temperature according to the magnitude of temperature and humidity changes, which was 40% more stable than traditional thermostats and saved 30% of electricity.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
