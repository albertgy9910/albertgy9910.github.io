**AlgoRoute: AI-Driven Logistics Route Planning System at JNU (Jun 2021 - Oct 2021)**  
**[View Project](https://github.com/albertgy9910/AlgoRoute)**

This project focused on optimizing logistics routes by employing advanced algorithms. The experiments conducted using Python identified optimal solutions for improving supply chain efficiency, achieving significant time and cost savings.

- Performed Python-based experiments to identify optimal algorithms for improving supply chain route efficiency.
- Utilized diverse algorithms like taboo, adaptive large neighborhood, ant colony, and genetic algorithm to achieve a 35% time reduction and 23% cost savings in route planning compared to single-algorithm applications.
- Optimized routes with customersâ€™ parameters like time windows, vehicle capacity, and vehicle transportation costs.
