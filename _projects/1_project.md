This project focuses on developing a framework to manage and improve data quality, with the goal of enhancing fairness and robustness in machine learning models. The work involves creating tools to handle data biases and conducting experiments to assess the effectiveness of these tools.

- Developed and implemented a framework for specifying and injecting complex data quality issues into datasets, using Python to address data biases and improve fairness and accuracy in machine learning models.
- Designed and executed experiments to evaluate the robustness of data cleaning tools and machine learning models against various data biases such as missing values, selection bias, and outliers.
- Collaborated on the development of a declarative language for pattern specification, allowing users to define intricate dependencies between dataset attributes to simulate real-world data corruption.
